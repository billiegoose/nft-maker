This is a fully operational proof-of-concept demonstrating a new, highly economical, non-fungible token contract that I wrote myself ([view source](https://etherscan.io/address/0xceabc60d96944de03566c007f9749abe61fd3381#code)).
Compared to the "big players" (e.g. Foundation, Rarible, OpenSea), which use about 200,000 gas, this contract only uses about 70,000 gas to mint tokens.
This service is provided AS IS with no guarantees, etc, etc; it's a hobby project.
The NFTs you mint with it are YOURS though, they will be owned by your wallet, and you can then sell them on OpenSea.
